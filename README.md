# Survival-Extint : Reinforcement-Learning
<B><h3>INTRODUCTION :</h3></B>
Survial Extint is an Reinforcement Learning based environment in which we have our agent
who struggles for his survival to reach its destination, here we take it as Food. 
In his way he have to face his Enemy who is way more powerful than him.<br> If they both have a dual with each 
other. Our agent is sure to fail !<br>
But here is a twist, <B>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</B> is there to help him. RL deploys <B>Q LEARNING</B> to help our agent. 

<B><h3>Q-LEARNING :</h3></B>
Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the value of an action in a particular state. It does not require a model of the environment (hence "model-free"), and it can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards without requiring adaptations (sources : <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning">Wikipedia</a>).<br>
Here, is an image to show the update rule of Q-Learning.<br><br>
